QA Java Project

Description: 
You have been invited to help zoologists: they are researching the feline family. To record their observations, the scientists use a special program. It is up to you to test a part of the program.

To increase the coverage, you must call each method of each class in a separate test. Write a separate test for each branch of the condition. Some branches will need a parameterized test or mocks.

Instructions: 
Isolate the Lion class from the Feline class. 
Write tests for the Feline, Cat, and Lion classes. 
Evaluate coverage with Jacoco: it should be 100%.
